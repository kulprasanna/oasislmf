Sphinx docs
===========

This repository is enabled with Sphinx documentation for the Python
modules, and the documentation is published to
https://oasislmf.github.io/Flamingo/ manually using the procedure
described below. (Note: GitHub pages is not enabled for this repository
because it contains `oasis_utils <https://github.com/OasisLMF/oasis_utils>`_ and `OasisAPIClient <https://github.com/OasisLMF/OasisAPIClient>`_  as private repositories, which
is incompatible with GitHub pages.)

Setting up Sphinx
-----------------

Firstly, to work on the Sphinx docs for this package you must have
Sphinx installed on your system or in your ``virtualenv`` environment
(recommended).

You should also clone the Oasis publication repository
https://github.com/OasisLMF/OasisLMF.github.io.

Building and publishing
-----------------------

The Sphinx documentation source files are reStructuredText files, and
are contained in the ``docs`` subfolder, which also contains the Sphinx
configuration file ``conf.py`` and the ``Makefile`` for the build. To do
a new build run

::

    make html

in the ``docs`` folder. You should see a new set of HTML files and
assets in the ``_build/html`` subfolder (the build directory can be
changed to ``docs`` itself in the ``Makefile`` but that is not
recommended). Now copy the files to the Oasis documentation publication
repository folder using

::

    cp -R _build/html/* /path/to/your/OasisLMF.github.io/Flamingo/

Add and ``git`` commit the new files in the publication repository, and
GitHub pages will automatically publish the new documents to the
documentation site https://oasislmf.github.io/Flamingo/.
