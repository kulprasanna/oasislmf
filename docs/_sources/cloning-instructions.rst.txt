========

Cloning the repository
----------------------

You can clone this repository using HTTPS or SSH, but it is recommended
that that you use SSH: first ensure that you have generated an SSH key
pair on your local machine and add the public key of that pair to your
GitHub account (use the GitHub guide at
https://help.github.com/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/). Then
run

::

    git clone --recursive git+ssh://git@github.com/OasisLMF/Flamingo

To clone over HTTPS use

::

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/OasisLMF/Flamingo.git

You may receive a password prompt - to bypass the password prompt use

::

    git clone --recursive https://<GitHub user name:GitHub password>@github.com/OasisLMF/Flamingo.git

The ``--recursive`` option ensures the cloned repository contains the
necessary Oasis repositories \ ``oasis_utils``\  as Git submodules.

Managing the submodules
-----------------------

Run the command

::

    git submodule

to list the submodules (latest commit IDs, paths and branches). If any
are missing then you can add them using

::

    git submodule add <submodule GitHub repo URL> <local path/destination>

It is a quirk of Git that the first time you clone a repository with
submodules they will be checked out as commits not branches, which is
not what you want. You should run the command

::

    git submodule foreach 'git checkout master'

to ensure that the Oasis submodules are checked out on the ``master``
branches.

If youâ€™ve already cloned the repository and wish to update the
submodules (all at once) in your working directory from their GitHub
repositories then run

::

    git submodule foreach 'git pull origin'

You can also update the submodules individually by pulling from within
them.

You should not make any local changes to these submodules because you
have read-only access to their GitHub repositories. So submodule changes
can only propagate from GitHub to your local repository. To detect these
changes you can run ``git status -uno`` and to commit them you can add
the paths and commit them in the normal way.
